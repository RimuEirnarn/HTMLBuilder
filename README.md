# HTMLBuilder

A simple project that does python to html stuff. Will add nasty features later on.

## Miscellaneous

Feel free to add pull request, especially for [/thetoolkit.py](https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/HTMLBuilder/blob/main/thetoolkit.py) as it's the generic version of something.

I'll add another stuff like w3css_plugin.py, like `thetoolkit.py` but it's automatically 'styled' and will have many more features on future.

If you want to add something like, bootstrap_plugin.py, just add pull-request. I'll review and happily (perhaps) merge your code.

## Depedency

This repo does not depends on anything else. Therefore, keeping its size small forever.

## Known issues

None, for now. Please add an issue if you have one.
