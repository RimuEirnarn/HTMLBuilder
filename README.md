# HTMLBuilder

A simple project that does python to html stuff. Will add nasty features later on.

## Miscellaneous

Feel free to add pull request, especially on [/thetoolkit.py](https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/HTMLBuilder/blob/main/thetoolkit.py) as it's the generic version of something.

I'll add another stuff like w3css_plugin.py, like `thetoolkit.py`, it's automatically 'styled' and have many more features on future.

If you want to add something like, bootstrap_plugin.py, just add pull-request. I'll review and happily merge your code.
